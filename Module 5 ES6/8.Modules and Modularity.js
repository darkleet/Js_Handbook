// Modularity :It means dividing our code into different different modules so that each module can have code of its need 
// and  can do different different task.

// for example we will create two different files one is a calculator file and other is a main file.
// In the calc file we will write all the functions which are needed for a calculator.
// Other is a main file where we will import the calc.js file see both the files for better understanding.
