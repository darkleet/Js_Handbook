#Variables in JS:
Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
Variables means anything that can vary.
In Js Variable stores the value that can be changed later on.

Declaring a variable:
There is a reserved keyword in Js which is used to declare variable in Js and i.e. var keyword.

Dynamically vs Statically Typed Language:
Statically typed language:Each variable and expression are already known at compile time
and also type checking is done at compile time.

Statically typed language:Variable can receive value at run time
and also type checking is done at run time.

#Arrays in Js:
Arrays can store multiple data items.
It enables storing multiple values under same variable name and we can also perform operations 
on them by using different methods and properties also every value gets a sequential index starting
from 0.

In javascript arrays can store values of different data types whereas in statically typed languages,
array can only store data in which it(array) is defined.


#Objects in Js#
Everything in Js is an Object.
In Js,an object is an unordered collection(i.e. does not have index value) of key-value pairs.
Each key value pair is called as property.

The key of a property can be a string.And the value of property can be anything i.e. string,integer,array,and even an function.

Js provides us with many ways to create an object.The most commonly used is object literal notation.
